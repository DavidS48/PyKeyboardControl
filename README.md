# PyKeyboardControl
Simple module for attaching python functions to keystrokes.

This module was inspired by a sprint at PyCon UK 2016, which attempted to create a module to allow Code Club students to trigger Python code with keypresses while playing Minecraft: Pi Edition.

The actual outcome of that sprint was Superkeys:

but I was left wondering whether another approach would also work.

This module is the other approach.
